A year since 2017, I was responsible for taking development owership of out-sourced project which had been lousily maintained for almost 2 years, so I struggled hard to find out how the unmanageble code could be refactored into manageable and extensible code. so I started to have an interest in meta programming support in Java and this project was initiated for learning experience of it. the first reason RMI is chosen as a project topic is that I was impressed by Retrofit, the HTTP client library, for its simple and intuitive API which delivered pleasant development experience to me at that time. so much of YARMI API resembles it from design perspective. and the second reason is that I was interested in data mining and analysis and tried to establish distributed data processing application at that time. in the context, I thought it would be nice if distributed node can be configured automatically based on service discovery and maintain high availability without human management. so I try to build simple proof-of-concept which is combination of SDP and RMI.

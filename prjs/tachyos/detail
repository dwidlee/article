From 2011, I had been involved in a number of projects related to the wearable electronic device generally based on constrained hardware (for example, ARM Cortex-M series, PIC32, etc.) so I thought that it was time to start something to challenge my knowledge and experience in baremetal programming spending spare time in 2015. so I decided to build my own version of simple operating system targeting ARM cortex-M(ARM v7M architecture) at first, which was most widely adopted from the industry. it had taken about a year to implement from the scheduler, which is essential part of the kernel, to the synchronization and had used in a number of prototype development. it has OS interface compliant to CMSIS-RTOS and ported to various SoCs(STM32F427 ~ 437xx, STMF2xx, STM32F40_41xx) manufactured by ST Micro.

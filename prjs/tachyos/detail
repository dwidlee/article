I had been involved in a number of projects related to the small electronic device based on constrained hardware since 2011 and after a few years, I started to feel confidence in my abilities to develop software for those kinds of targets. so I decided to start building operating system from scratch which was believed to be appropriate challenge for them. it had taken almost a year to implement basic kernel functionalities from scheduler, which manages CPU time as resource, to the synchronization elements like mutex, condition variable, and HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer) implementation for a few targets. I had used it to build simple prototypes for demo in a few proof-of-concept projects and it brought me a lot of saving of both time and effort at that time. Although I had stopped developing it actively after almost 2 years since the beginning, it was invaluable experience for me as much as it was challenging.

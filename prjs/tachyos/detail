From 2014 to 2015, I had been involved in a number of projects related to the wearable electronic device generally based on constrained hardware (for example, ARM Cortex-M series, PIC32, etc.) and I'd like to start something to challenge my knowledge and experience in baremetal programming in spare time. so I decided to build my own version of simple operating system for ARM cortex-M (ARM v7m architecture), which was most widely adopted from the industry. it had taken about a year to implement from the scheduler, which is essential part of the kernel, to the synchronization and had used in a number of prototype development.

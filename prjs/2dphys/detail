When I started to learn Java programing language at 2009, I was intrigued by Physics engine used to make object interaction in the game more realistic. so I wrote a simple program which can simulate 2D particle physics. At that time I was not familiar with the topics like caching and synchronization between threads. so you might notice some weired movement of object from the demo movie. however, to buid somthing quite complex from just a few set of simple rule that I learned in phyics class was very fascinated to me at that time

    "description": "I was working on small operating system project (TachyOS) for very constrained hardware (like 512k Flash / 128k SRAM) personally 2015 so memory efficient data structure implementation which can be easily built on constrained free hosting target was required. I tried other open source libraries that is suitable for baremetal project (means no depd  so I decided to build my own. unusual aspect of this project is use of recursion on implementing balanced tree. the recursion is generally considered impractical though, for balanced tree, the recursion depth can be maintained reasonable level. and the recursion has beneficial impact on memory footprint. because tree node doesn't need to have pointer to parent node. so size of data structure could be reduced.",

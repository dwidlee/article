I had been working as a hardware engineer since 2006 to 2009 and my interest started to move slowly to embedded software because I was so fascinated to the power which embedded software can bring to the simple device. so I started to study baremetal programing using low-cost micro controller kit (at that time, mostly 8 bit ATMEL MCU based) and after 2 years from the begining, I could achive proficiency in writing programs, debugging in free hosting (baremetal) environment into various targets (including ATMEL / ARM Cortex-M / TI MSP Series) with low cost programmer (e.g. JLINK)
